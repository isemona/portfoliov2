    <p>1. Why I decided to join a bootcamp?
    At a certain point in your growing and learning phase you hit a point where you are stagnant. I recognized 
    this was happening to me and saw no clear path of being promoted to the next level at my current company. 
    I decided to take action and forge a path of my own and so I researched and tried different options 
    to see which one was best for me. I've tried Codecademy Pro and Udacity's Nanodegree program, but felt there 
    were still missing links in my education and understanding as a beginner. I've tried freeCodeCamp and 
    HackReactor's Pre-Immersive Course to see if I preferred JavaScript over Python. In the end and because of 
    my learning style - Total Immersion - I chose to join a bootcamp specifically Hackbright for their mission 
    to close the gap, Python based curriculum, mentorship program, career transitioning assistance, and strong
    alumnae gcommunity. 

    If you want to go far seek education and mentorship.
