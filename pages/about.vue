        I am told a <strong>whippersnapper</strong> jokingly equates to a millenial. Merriam-Webster defines a 
        whippersnapper to be: <em>a young person who annoys older people by being very confident and acting like 
        someone important</em>. It is a word often used to describe millenials taking over Silicon Valley, 
        but I'd like to think we are just a generation shaped by the ones before us. I'd like to think that a 
        <i>whippersnapper</i> is someone with creative solutions to real-world problems; albeit young and 
        inexperienced, they are bold and full of ideas to change the world around them.

        As a Scientist/Public Health Worker turned Software Developer, I am most interested in the intersection
        of healthcare and technology. I moved to the Bay Area from an island in the Pacific Ocean called Saipan. 
        Here, I volunteered at the local hospital helping patients to understand and educate/manage diabetes and 
        other preventable illnesses. I also volunteered at a women's shelter; where I taught English to women 
        from different countries looking to find work on the island and transition to healthier lives. In 2013, 
        I moved to San Francisco, where I volunteered as a public health intern with AmeriCorps under 
        San Francisco Department of Public Health. Again, I have seen a disconnect with how our current 
        healthcare system operates; a system more focused on the end result and not enough on prevention 
        and education.

        I aim to research and contribute to current technological efforts out there -- efforts that help to 
        improve heathcare at its current state. I love collaborating with hackers, bioengineers, researchers, 
        clinicians, and even citizen scientists -- the very heroes I draw inspiration from. Exposure from groups 
        like BioCurious and events like Makerfaire that I finally realized this.

        I'm the curious type. I love to learn from other people and adapt to my environment. 
        I see oportunities all around me and do my best to seize everyone of them; I am amazed and enjoy how 
        these spontaneous collaborations pan out. I love working with diverse teams and feel like I have much to 
        give and learn from them as well. Energtic/motivated team fuel me to accompish meaningful goals.
