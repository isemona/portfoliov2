      <h1 class="title">About</h1>
      <div>
        I was born and raised on a US Commonwealth called Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands in the Mid-Pacific. 
        I am a first-generation college graduate with a degree in Science (STEM). I've always envisioned myself solving 
        problems in health. With the original intention of going into Medicine or Public Health, 
        I initially came out to the Bay Area to serve as a volunteer for AmeriCorps under the San Francisco Department of Public Health; 
        it was here that I stumbled upon the Silicon Valley and into tech. I’ve worked for a startup company for three years as 
        a technical support agent and taught myself to code along the way. One day, I decided to fully immerse myself in 
        code and attend Hackbright Academy - an all-women's bootcamp. I’ve worked in high pressure, limited resource environments 
        that have pushed me outside my comfort zone to find creative solutions to get the job done. 
      </div></br>
      <h2 class="interests">Interests</h2>
      <div>
        Currently, I use my background in science and software engineering skills as a volunteer at the California Academy of Sciences, 
        assisting a lead scientist to improve his website for a citizen-science project on a community-powered app, iNaturalist. 
        More importantly, his work uses machine learning to classify disease-carrying mosquitoes. I'm happy to help him get his public 
        health message across and to help educate students in The Big Island of Hawaii about mosquitos that carry potentially 
        life-threatening diseases such as dengue fever.
      </div></br>
      <div>
        As a Scientist/Public Health Worker turned Software Developer, I am most interested in the intersection
        of healthcare and technology. In Saipan, I volunteered at the local hospital educating patients and helping them to
        understand and manage diabetes and other preventable illnesses. I also volunteered at a local women's shelter, where I 
        taught English to women from different countries looking to find work on the island and transition to healthier lives. 
        After my time in Saipan and AmeriCorps, I observed a disconnect with how our current 
        healthcare system operates; a system more focused on the end result and not enough on prevention 
        and education.
      </div></br>
      <div>
        I aim to research and contribute to current technological efforts out there -- efforts that help to 
        improve heathcare at its current state. I love collaborating with hackers, bioengineers, researchers, 
        clinicians, and even citizen scientists -- the heroes I draw inspiration from. Exposure from groups 
        like BioCurious and events like Makerfaire have lead me to this path.
