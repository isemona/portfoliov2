      <p>I am told a <strong>whippersnapper</strong> jokingly equates to a millenial. Merriam-Webster defines a whippersnapper to be: <em>a young person who annoys older people by being very confident and acting like someone important</em>. It is a word often used to describe the millenials taking over Silicon Valley, but I'd like to think we are just a generation shaped by the ones before us. I'd like to think that a <i>whippersnapper</i> is someone with creative solutions to real world problems; albeit young and inexperienced and more like bold and full of ideas to change the world around them.</p>

      <p>I am most interested in how technology can be incorporated in health. I moved from a secluded island in the Pacific Ocean called Saipan. Here, I volunteered at the local hospital and women's shelter; working closely with patients and women dealing with diabetes and other preventable illnesses. Since then, I have moved to San Francisco, where I did some public health work with AmeriCorps under Department of Public Health. Again, I have seen a disconnect with how healthcare operates; a system more focused on the end result and not heavily on preventative care.</p>

      <p>I aim to research and contribute to current technological efforts out there -- efforts that help to improve heathcare at its current state. I love collaborating with hackers, bioengineers, researchers, clinicians, and even citizen scientists -- the very heroes I draw inspiration from; it was at BioCurious and Makerfaire that I finally realized this.</p>

      <p>I'm also a very curious person. I love to learn from other people and adapt to my environment. I see oportunities all around me and do my best to seize everyone of them. I love working with diverse teams and feel like I have much to learn from them. I feed from their energy which fuels me to accompish meaningful goals.</p>
